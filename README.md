My name is Tyler Freeman, I recently graduated with a BBA in Finance from Florida Atlantic University
My current career goals are to continue building upon my analytical skills and work my way into the private equity field
I chose Fintech as a career path because of the direction of current trends that both the Finance and Technology industries are heading towards.
